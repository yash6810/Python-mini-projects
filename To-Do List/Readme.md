Python To-Do List Application
📝 Project Overview
This is a simple, console-based To-Do List application built with Python. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding new tasks, viewing existing ones, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks. The application ensures data persistence by saving tasks to a text file, making your to-do list available even after closing and reopening the program.

This mini-project is a practical example of fundamental Python concepts, including file I/O, object-oriented programming (OOP), and basic user interaction via the command line. It's designed to be straightforward to understand, making it a great starting point for beginners exploring Python applications.

✨ Features
Add Tasks: Quickly add new tasks to your list.
View Tasks: See all your tasks, clearly indicating which ones are completed and which are pending.
Mark as Done: Mark tasks as complete once you've finished them.
Delete Task: Remove tasks from your list when they are no longer needed.
Persistence: Your tasks are automatically saved to todo.txt and loaded when the application starts, so you never lose your list.
