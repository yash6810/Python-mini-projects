✨ Python To-Do List Application ✨
🚀 Project At a Glance
Ever feel overwhelmed by scattered notes and forgotten tasks? This Python To-Do List application is your simple, yet powerful, command-line companion for effortless task management! Built entirely in Python, it lets you seamlessly add, view, complete, and delete your daily tasks, all while ensuring your precious list persists across sessions. No more losing track of what needs doing!

This isn't just a basic script; it's a hands-on demonstration of core Python fundamentals, including robust file I/O for data persistence, practical Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and intuitive command-line interaction. It's a clean, well-structured mini-project designed to showcase efficient problem-solving and foundational programming skills.

🌟 Key Features
⚡️ Quick Task Addition: Instantly add new tasks to keep your mind clear.
👀 Clear Task Overview: See all your tasks at a glance, with clear indicators for completed items.
✅ Effortless Completion: Mark tasks as done with a single command.
🗑️ Simple Task Deletion: Remove completed or irrelevant tasks to maintain a tidy list.
💾 Automatic Persistence: Your tasks are automatically saved to todo.txt and loaded on startup, so your list is always exactly where you left it.
🛠️ Getting Started
Ready to organize your day? Follow these simple steps to get the To-Do List running on your local machine!

Prerequisites
You'll just need Python 3 installed on your system.

Python: Grab the latest version from python.org.
Installation & Execution
Since this To-Do List is a sub-project within a larger collection of Python mini-projects, here's how to get it going:

Clone the main repository:

Bash
```
git clone https://github.com/yash6810/Python-mini-projects.git
Navigate to the To-Do List project directory:
```

Bash
```
cd "Python-mini-projects/To-Do List"
```

Launch the application:

Bash
```
python todo_app.py
```

🚀 How to Use
Once the application is up and running, you'll be greeted by a friendly menu in your terminal. Just type the number corresponding to your desired action and press Enter!

➖➖➖ Your To-Do List ⭐ ➖➖➖
1. View tasks 🔍
2. Add tasks ➕
3. Mark task as completed ✅
4. Delete task 💀
5. Exit 🚩
➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

Enter your choice:

Enter 1 to view your entire list of tasks.

Enter 2 to add a new task. The program will prompt you for the task description.

Enter 3 to mark a task as complete. You'll simply provide the number of the task from your list.

Enter 4 to delete a task. Again, just enter its corresponding number.

Enter 5 to exit the application cleanly.

📂 Project Architecture

The project maintains a clean and logical structure:

.
├── todo_app.py         # The heart of the application: contains all To-Do List logic.
└── todo.txt            # Your digital notepad: where all your tasks are saved and loaded.
└── README.md           # You're reading it! Project documentation.

💡 Why This Project? (Technical Insights)

This To-Do List application was developed to solidify core Python programming concepts in a practical, user-facing context. It demonstrates proficiency in:

Object-Oriented Design: Encapsulating task management logic within the TodoList class promotes modularity and reusability.

File Handling (os module & open()): Efficiently reading from and writing to todo.txt ensures seamless data persistence, a crucial aspect of real-world applications.

User Interaction: Implementing robust input() handling and clear print() statements for a smooth command-line experience.

Error Handling (try-except): Gracefully managing invalid user inputs (e.g., non-numeric task numbers) to prevent crashes and enhance user experience.

🌱 Future Enhancements

I'm always thinking about how to evolve and improve my projects! Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:

Task Prioritization: Add a feature to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to tasks.

Due Dates: Implement an option to set and display due dates for tasks.

Filtering & Sorting: Allow users to filter tasks by completion status or sort them by priority/due date.

Categories: Enable assigning categories to tasks (e.g., "Work," "Personal," "Groceries").
